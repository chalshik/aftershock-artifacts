## 2026-10-23 · Harness layout deviates slightly from the plan
- Schedule generation lives in `harness/workload.py` (not inside `run.py`) so it can be unit-tested.
- Prompts are stored once per session in `prompts.parquet`. A turn's prompt is `tokens[:prompt_len]`, since each turn extends the previous one. This keeps long-run schedules small.
- The check verdict goes to `runs/<id>/checks.json`. The analysis helpers are `analysis/load.py` (not `io.py`, which would shadow the stdlib).

## 2026-10-23 · vLLM pinned to 0.32.0
- Latest stable release on PyPI on this date. Locked in `uv.lock` (torch 2.13.0). Confirm the driver supports torch's CUDA build on the VM (`env/setup_vm.sh`).

## 2026-10-23 · Initial workload parameters (pre-registered, before any run)
- Sessions: 8 turns, 512 system tokens, 128 user tokens and 128 recorded-reply tokens per turn, exponential turn gap with a 20 s mean, 128 output tokens.
- Session start rate = λ / turns, so the steady request rate is λ. Warm-up is 240 s (covers the ramp-up of about 8 × 20 s).
- Latency is measured from the **planned** arrival time (open loop).
- Run checks: client lag p99 ≤ 50 ms, scrape gap ≤ 2 s, arrival count within max(15 %, 3σ Poisson), SM-clock CV ≤ 5 %, no thermal throttle bits.

## Pending (fill in BEFORE looking at the results they judge)
- Repeatability tolerance (run 3): e.g. TTFT p50/p99 and throughput within ±X % between repeats.
- Capacity definition for μ_warm and μ_off: highest λ with throughput ≥ F·λ and waiting-queue slope ≤ S. Proposed F = 0.95, S = 0.01 req/s².
- Sweep λ grid refinement around the knee after first_real.

## 2026-10-23 · vLLM 0.32.0 verified against the official docs and source (tag v0.32.0)
- **Stable:** v0.32.0 is the "Latest" GitHub release, published 2026-10-18, and is not a pre-release or yanked on PyPI. It supports Python 3.11–3.14 on Linux x86-64/aarch64. It is a fresh `.0` release: if a 0.32.1 bug-fix appears before the first real run, consider it and log the decision.
- **Flags** (docs `configuration/engine_args`): `--enable-prefix-caching` / `--no-enable-prefix-caching` (the default is on, `CacheConfig.enable_prefix_caching = True`); `--kv-cache-metrics` (default off, sampled by `--kv-cache-metrics-sample`, default 0.01); `--gpu-memory-utilization` (default 0.92); `--seed` (default 0); KV offloading (`--kv-offloading-size`, `--cpu-offload-gb`) is off by default.
- **Added `--enable-prompt-tokens-details`:** the source (`entrypoints/openai/completion/serving.py`) returns `cached_tokens` per request only when it is set.
- **Completions API** (`entrypoints/openai/completion/protocol.py`): `prompt` accepts `list[int]`, and `min_tokens`, `ignore_eos` and `stream_options` are supported.
- **Metric names** (docs `usage/metrics`) match the harness: `prefix_cache_hits/queries`, `prompt_tokens(_cached)`, `num_requests_running/waiting`, `kv_cache_usage_perc`, `num_preemptions`, `request_success`, `kv_block_idle_before_evict_seconds`, `admission_rejections`.
- **For Stage 2:** `/reset_prefix_cache` exists, but only with `VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1`.
