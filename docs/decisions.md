## 2026-10-23 · Harness layout deviates slightly from the plan
- Schedule generation lives in `harness/workload.py` (not inside `run.py`) so it can be unit-tested.
- Prompts are stored once per session in `prompts.parquet`. A turn's prompt is `tokens[:prompt_len]`, since each turn extends the previous one. This keeps long-run schedules small.
- The check verdict goes to `runs/<id>/checks.json`. The analysis helpers are `analysis/load.py` (not `io.py`, which would shadow the stdlib).

## 2026-10-23 · vLLM pinned to 0.32.0
- Latest stable release on PyPI on this date. Locked in `uv.lock` (torch 2.13.0). Confirm the driver supports torch's CUDA build on the VM (`env/setup_vm.sh`).

## 2026-10-23 · Initial workload parameters (pre-registered, before any run)
- Sessions: 8 turns, 512 system tokens, 128 user tokens and 128 recorded-reply tokens per turn, exponential turn gap with a 20 s mean, 128 output tokens.
- Session start rate = λ / turns, so the steady request rate is λ. Warm-up is 240 s (covers the ramp-up of about 8 × 20 s).
- Latency is measured from the **planned** arrival time (open loop).
- Run checks: client lag p99 ≤ 50 ms, scrape gap ≤ 2 s, arrival count within max(15 %, 3σ Poisson), SM-clock CV ≤ 5 %, no thermal throttle bits.

## Pending (fill in BEFORE looking at the results they judge)
- Repeatability tolerance (run 3): e.g. TTFT p50/p99 and throughput within ±X % between repeats.
- Capacity definition for μ_warm and μ_off: highest λ with throughput ≥ F·λ and waiting-queue slope ≤ S. Proposed F = 0.95, S = 0.01 req/s².
- Sweep λ grid refinement around the knee after first_real.

## 2026-10-23 · vLLM 0.32.0 verified against the official docs and source (tag v0.32.0)
- **Stable:** v0.32.0 is the "Latest" GitHub release, published 2026-10-18, and is not a pre-release or yanked on PyPI. It supports Python 3.11–3.14 on Linux x86-64/aarch64. It is a fresh `.0` release: if a 0.32.1 bug-fix appears before the first real run, consider it and log the decision.
- **Flags** (docs `configuration/engine_args`): `--enable-prefix-caching` / `--no-enable-prefix-caching` (the default is on, `CacheConfig.enable_prefix_caching = True`); `--kv-cache-metrics` (default off, sampled by `--kv-cache-metrics-sample`, default 0.01); `--gpu-memory-utilization` (default 0.92); `--seed` (default 0); KV offloading (`--kv-offloading-size`, `--cpu-offload-gb`) is off by default.
- **Added `--enable-prompt-tokens-details`:** the source (`entrypoints/openai/completion/serving.py`) returns `cached_tokens` per request only when it is set.
- **Completions API** (`entrypoints/openai/completion/protocol.py`): `prompt` accepts `list[int]`, and `min_tokens`, `ignore_eos` and `stream_options` are supported.
- **Metric names** (docs `usage/metrics`) match the harness: `prefix_cache_hits/queries`, `prompt_tokens(_cached)`, `num_requests_running/waiting`, `kv_cache_usage_perc`, `num_preemptions`, `request_success`, `kv_block_idle_before_evict_seconds`, `admission_rejections`.
- **For Stage 2:** `/reset_prefix_cache` exists, but only with `VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1`.

## 2026-10-23 · VM facts and CPU pinning
- VM: Ubuntu 24.04.5, kernel 6.8, 8 vCPUs (AMD EPYC 7702P, 1 NUMA node), 31 GB RAM, 62 GB disk (46 GB free). The RTX 3090 (GA102) is passed through, but `nouveau` was loaded and no NVIDIA driver was installed.
- The driver must support CUDA 13 (the locked torch uses the cu13 runtime 13.0–13.4), so it must be ≥ 580. Install the Ubuntu-recommended `nvidia-driver-595-open`.
- Pinning: vLLM on cores 0–5, loadgen on 6, recorder on 7 (open question 6). Whether one core is enough for loadgen is checked by client lag in every run.

## 2026-10-23 · GPU driver setup on the VM (how it was made to work)
- **Driver:** `nvidia-driver-595-open` 595.99.02 (supports up to CUDA 13.2; torch uses 13.0) with Canonical's **prebuilt, signed** kernel modules `linux-modules-nvidia-595-open-generic`. The self-built DKMS module was removed: Secure Boot is on and its signing key was never enrolled, so the kernel refused it.
- **Proxmox:** the GPU's ROM was not passed to the VM, so the driver failed (`kgspExtractVbiosFromRom: did not find valid ROM signature`, `RmInitAdapter failed`). Fixed in the VM's `hostpci` settings on the Proxmox host. The VM needs a full stop/start after such changes.
- **GPU:** RTX 3090, 24 GB, power limit **420 W** (Gigabyte board, subsystem 1458:4041; reference spec is 350 W), max SM clock 2160 MHz. The power limit stays at its default during Stage 1, and `gpu.jsonl` records it every second.

## 2026-10-23 · Use uv-managed Python, not the system Python
- **Evidence:** the first `vllm serve` on the VM failed with `cuda_utils.c: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory`. Triton compiles a C helper at startup, and Ubuntu's `/usr/bin/python3.12` has no development headers.
- **Fix:** `[tool.uv] python-preference = "only-managed"`. uv's CPython build includes the headers, needs no sudo, and is the same build on the Mac and the VM. `uv.lock` is unchanged. `env.json` records the exact Python version for every run.

## 2026-10-23 · uv.lock change: prebuilt FlashInfer kernels (rule 3)
- **Evidence:** the second `vllm serve` failed at startup with `RuntimeError: Could not find nvcc` inside `flashinfer.sampling` (vLLM's default FlashInfer top-k/top-p sampler JIT-compiles a kernel). The VM has no CUDA toolkit. vLLM's own startup warning recommends `vllm download-kernels`.
- **Fix:** pin exactly what `vllm download-kernels --dry-run` would install for flashinfer 0.7.0.post1 / CUDA 13.0: `flashinfer-cubin==0.7.0.post1` and `flashinfer-jit-cache==0.7.0.post1+cu130`, plus its per-architecture packages (the RTX 3090 uses `sm80`), all from flashinfer.ai's official index. They are in `uv.lock` instead of a one-off install, so `uv sync` keeps them and every run is pinned.
- **Supporting settings:** `tool.uv.environments` is limited to Linux x86_64 and macOS arm64. `override-dependencies` restricts the ARM-only `sm110a`/`sm121a` packages to aarch64, because uv assumes one metadata set for all wheels.
- **Effect on Linux x86_64:** only the 8 FlashInfer packages are added. vllm 0.32.0, torch 2.13.0, flashinfer-python 0.7.0.post1 and the CUDA 13.0 runtime libraries are unchanged. The removed lock entries were Windows-only packages and CUDA 13.4 variants that were never installed.
- **Kept at vLLM's default** (no `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0`), so the server stays production-like.

## 2026-10-23 · gpu_steady check refined after the first smoke run (harness debugging, before any measurement)
- **Evidence:** run `20261023-145613_smoke` is INVALID on `gpu_steady`. One of 66 samples had mask `0x24` (SW power cap + SW thermal slowdown) at 53 °C, with the SM clock at its 2040 MHz maximum. Clock CV was 4.4%, only because the GPU alternated idle (1860 MHz) and busy (2040 MHz) at λ = 0.5. Neither is a hardware slowdown.
- **New rule** (configs/base.yaml `checks`): any HW throttle bit (0x8, 0x40, 0x80) in any sample fails the run. SW thermal (0x20) fails it only above 5% of samples. SM-clock CV ≤ 5% is computed over busy samples (util ≥ 50%). The SW power cap (0x4) is ignored, since it is normal boost behaviour.
- That smoke run stays INVALID as recorded. It is not re-judged.
