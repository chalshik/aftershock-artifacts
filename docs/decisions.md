## 2026-10-23 · Harness layout deviates slightly from the plan
- Schedule generation lives in `harness/workload.py` (not inside `run.py`) so it can be unit-tested.
- Prompts are stored once per session in `prompts.parquet`. A turn's prompt is `tokens[:prompt_len]`, since each turn extends the previous one. This keeps long-run schedules small.
- The check verdict goes to `runs/<id>/checks.json`. The analysis helpers are `analysis/load.py` (not `io.py`, which would shadow the stdlib).

## 2026-10-23 · vLLM pinned to 0.32.0
- Latest stable release on PyPI on this date. Locked in `uv.lock` (torch 2.13.0). Confirm the driver supports torch's CUDA build on the VM (`env/setup_vm.sh`).

## 2026-10-23 · Initial workload parameters (pre-registered, before any run)
- Sessions: 8 turns, 512 system tokens, 128 user tokens and 128 recorded-reply tokens per turn, exponential turn gap with a 20 s mean, 128 output tokens.
- Session start rate = λ / turns, so the steady request rate is λ. Warm-up is 240 s (covers the ramp-up of about 8 × 20 s).
- Latency is measured from the **planned** arrival time (open loop).
- Run checks: client lag p99 ≤ 50 ms, scrape gap ≤ 2 s, arrival count within max(15 %, 3σ Poisson), SM-clock CV ≤ 5 %, no thermal throttle bits.

## Pending (fill in BEFORE looking at the results they judge)
- Repeatability tolerance (run 3): e.g. TTFT p50/p99 and throughput within ±X % between repeats.
- Capacity definition for μ_warm and μ_off: highest λ with throughput ≥ F·λ and waiting-queue slope ≤ S. Proposed F = 0.95, S = 0.01 req/s².
- Sweep λ grid refinement around the knee after first_real.

## 2026-10-23 · vLLM 0.32.0 verified against the official docs and source (tag v0.32.0)
- **Stable:** v0.32.0 is the "Latest" GitHub release, published 2026-10-18, and is not a pre-release or yanked on PyPI. It supports Python 3.11–3.14 on Linux x86-64/aarch64. It is a fresh `.0` release: if a 0.32.1 bug-fix appears before the first real run, consider it and log the decision.
- **Flags** (docs `configuration/engine_args`): `--enable-prefix-caching` / `--no-enable-prefix-caching` (the default is on, `CacheConfig.enable_prefix_caching = True`); `--kv-cache-metrics` (default off, sampled by `--kv-cache-metrics-sample`, default 0.01); `--gpu-memory-utilization` (default 0.92); `--seed` (default 0); KV offloading (`--kv-offloading-size`, `--cpu-offload-gb`) is off by default.
- **Added `--enable-prompt-tokens-details`:** the source (`entrypoints/openai/completion/serving.py`) returns `cached_tokens` per request only when it is set.
- **Completions API** (`entrypoints/openai/completion/protocol.py`): `prompt` accepts `list[int]`, and `min_tokens`, `ignore_eos` and `stream_options` are supported.
- **Metric names** (docs `usage/metrics`) match the harness: `prefix_cache_hits/queries`, `prompt_tokens(_cached)`, `num_requests_running/waiting`, `kv_cache_usage_perc`, `num_preemptions`, `request_success`, `kv_block_idle_before_evict_seconds`, `admission_rejections`.
- **For Stage 2:** `/reset_prefix_cache` exists, but only with `VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1`.

## 2026-10-23 · VM facts and CPU pinning
- VM: Ubuntu 24.04.5, kernel 6.8, 8 vCPUs (AMD EPYC 7702P, 1 NUMA node), 31 GB RAM, 62 GB disk (46 GB free). The RTX 3090 (GA102) is passed through, but `nouveau` was loaded and no NVIDIA driver was installed.
- The driver must support CUDA 13 (the locked torch uses the cu13 runtime 13.0–13.4), so it must be ≥ 580. Install the Ubuntu-recommended `nvidia-driver-595-open`.
- Pinning: vLLM on cores 0–5, loadgen on 6, recorder on 7 (open question 6). Whether one core is enough for loadgen is checked by client lag in every run.

## 2026-10-23 · GPU driver setup on the VM (how it was made to work)
- **Driver:** `nvidia-driver-595-open` 595.99.02 (supports up to CUDA 13.2; torch uses 13.0) with Canonical's **prebuilt, signed** kernel modules `linux-modules-nvidia-595-open-generic`. The self-built DKMS module was removed: Secure Boot is on and its signing key was never enrolled, so the kernel refused it.
- **Proxmox:** the GPU's ROM was not passed to the VM, so the driver failed (`kgspExtractVbiosFromRom: did not find valid ROM signature`, `RmInitAdapter failed`). Fixed in the VM's `hostpci` settings on the Proxmox host. The VM needs a full stop/start after such changes.
- **GPU:** RTX 3090, 24 GB, power limit **420 W** (Gigabyte board, subsystem 1458:4041; reference spec is 350 W), max SM clock 2160 MHz. The power limit stays at its default during Stage 1, and `gpu.jsonl` records it every second.

## 2026-10-23 · Use uv-managed Python, not the system Python
- **Evidence:** the first `vllm serve` on the VM failed with `cuda_utils.c: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory`. Triton compiles a C helper at startup, and Ubuntu's `/usr/bin/python3.12` has no development headers.
- **Fix:** `[tool.uv] python-preference = "only-managed"`. uv's CPython build includes the headers, needs no sudo, and is the same build on the Mac and the VM. `uv.lock` is unchanged. `env.json` records the exact Python version for every run.

## 2026-10-23 · uv.lock change: prebuilt FlashInfer kernels (rule 3)
- **Evidence:** the second `vllm serve` failed at startup with `RuntimeError: Could not find nvcc` inside `flashinfer.sampling` (vLLM's default FlashInfer top-k/top-p sampler JIT-compiles a kernel). The VM has no CUDA toolkit. vLLM's own startup warning recommends `vllm download-kernels`.
- **Fix:** pin exactly what `vllm download-kernels --dry-run` would install for flashinfer 0.7.0.post1 / CUDA 13.0: `flashinfer-cubin==0.7.0.post1` and `flashinfer-jit-cache==0.7.0.post1+cu130`, plus its per-architecture packages (the RTX 3090 uses `sm80`), all from flashinfer.ai's official index. They are in `uv.lock` instead of a one-off install, so `uv sync` keeps them and every run is pinned.
- **Supporting settings:** `tool.uv.environments` is limited to Linux x86_64 and macOS arm64. `override-dependencies` restricts the ARM-only `sm110a`/`sm121a` packages to aarch64, because uv assumes one metadata set for all wheels.
- **Effect on Linux x86_64:** only the 8 FlashInfer packages are added. vllm 0.32.0, torch 2.13.0, flashinfer-python 0.7.0.post1 and the CUDA 13.0 runtime libraries are unchanged. The removed lock entries were Windows-only packages and CUDA 13.4 variants that were never installed.
- **Kept at vLLM's default** (no `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0`), so the server stays production-like.

## 2026-10-23 · gpu_steady check refined after the first smoke run (harness debugging, before any measurement)
- **Evidence:** run `20261023-145613_smoke` is INVALID on `gpu_steady`. One of 66 samples had mask `0x24` (SW power cap + SW thermal slowdown) at 53 °C, with the SM clock at its 2040 MHz maximum. Clock CV was 4.4%, only because the GPU alternated idle (1860 MHz) and busy (2040 MHz) at λ = 0.5. Neither is a hardware slowdown.
- **New rule** (configs/base.yaml `checks`): any HW throttle bit (0x8, 0x40, 0x80) in any sample fails the run. SW thermal (0x20) fails it only above 5% of samples. SM-clock CV ≤ 5% is computed over busy samples (util ≥ 50%). The SW power cap (0x4) is ignored, since it is normal boost behaviour.
- That smoke run stays INVALID as recorded. It is not re-judged.

## 2026-10-30 · Repeat tolerance and capacity rule pre-registered (before any sessions-workload run)
Supersedes the first two "Pending" items above. Written before `first_real` ran; the only data so far is the two smoke runs (1.7B, random prompts, λ = 0.5), which say nothing about these numbers.
- **Repeat tolerance (step 3):** `first_real` and two runs of `repeat.yaml` (same seed), compared pairwise using `analysis/load.py` `summarize()` over the measured window. They agree if every pair is within: throughput ±2 %, TTFT p50 ±10 %, TTFT p99 ±25 %, hit rate ±0.02 absolute. Relative differences are taken against the smaller of the pair. p99 gets more room because it rests on about 13 of 1,320 requests at λ = 2. A miss is reported as a miss; the tolerance is not widened afterwards.
- **Capacity rule (steps 4–5):** μ is the highest swept λ whose run is valid, with throughput ≥ 0.95 λ and waiting-queue slope ≤ 0.01 req/s², both over the measured window (F and S as proposed above; `analysis/load.py` `capacity()`).
- The sweep λ grid stays pending until after step 2, as planned.

## 2026-10-30 · VM address changed
- After a reboot the VM came up on 192.168.3.249 instead of 192.168.3.243 (DHCP). Same machine: the SSH host keys match the ones recorded for the old address. The Mac's `vm` remote now points to the new address. SSH uses `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_vllm`; the Mac's default key is not authorized there.

## 2026-10-30 · Failed start `20261030-114021_first_real` (operator error, no load sent)
- **Evidence:** `server.log` says `taskset: failed to execute vllm: No such file or directory`; `events.jsonl` has `server_failed` with return code 127. I had run `uv sync --frozen` on the VM without `--extra server`, which uninstalled vLLM, torch and the other server packages.
- **Fix:** `uv sync --frozen --extra server` (the command in `env/setup_vm.sh`). vLLM 0.32.0 and torch 2.13.0 are back, `uv.lock` is unchanged, and `env_snapshot` matches the valid smoke run on every field except the git commit.
- The folder is kept as it is. It has no `checks.json` because `run.py` exits before the checks when the server never starts, so `find_runs()` already leaves it out with its default `valid_only`. It does not count as a step 2 run.

## 2026-10-30 · Step 3 result: repeats agree within the pre-registered tolerance
- **Evidence:** `20261030-114115_first_real`, `20261030-120420_repeat`, `20261030-122024_repeat`. All three are VALID, with the same workload and seed. `first_real` ran at commit 0178705 and the repeats at bcdaa6e; the only change between them is in docs.
- **Largest pairwise differences:** throughput 0.00 % (limit 2 %), TTFT p50 0.83 % (limit 10 %), TTFT p99 2.31 % (limit 25 %), hit rate 0.0006 (limit 0.02).
- **Limits of this result:** all runs share one seed, so this shows the server and harness repeat on an identical schedule, not how much results vary across schedules. Throughput cannot differ below capacity, because every request completes, so that row is a weak test here. The limits turned out much wider than the observed differences. They stay as registered.

## 2026-10-30 · Sweep λ grid kept (before any sweep run)
- Steps 4 and 5 use the existing grid [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10] from `sweep_pc_on.yaml`. **Why:** the λ = 2 runs had an empty queue and KV usage of 22 % at most, so they say nothing about where the knee is. Both sweeps use the same grid so the curves compare point by point.
- If the knee falls in a wide gap, extra rates go in a new config, logged here before they run. μ is only known to the resolution of the rates actually run.

## 2026-10-30 · `20261030-145339_sweep_pc_on_r8` is INVALID on `accounting`
- **Evidence:** `checks.json` reports 5,146 ok at the client and 5,147 in vLLM's success counter, an off-by-one. The other 1,543 of 6,689 requests were still unfinished at the 300 s drain deadline and count as misses. `request_success_total` shows no aborts or errors, and every other check passed.
- **Likely cause, not proven:** a request finished in vLLM just as loadgen hit the drain deadline, so the client cancelled it before reading its last chunk. `requests.jsonl` does not hold enough detail to confirm this. 72 of the unfinished requests had already received a first token.
- The run stays INVALID as recorded and is not re-judged, so it cannot count toward μ under the capacity rule. Any change to the check needs its own entry before the runs it judges.

## 2026-10-30 · Step 4 result: μ_warm = 4 req/s
- **Evidence:** sweep `20261030-131243_sweep_pc_on_r1` to `20261030-151441_sweep_pc_on_r10`, capacity rule as registered (F = 0.95, S = 0.01). λ = 1–6 and 10 are VALID; λ = 8 is INVALID on `accounting`. λ = 4 passes (queue slope 0.000); λ = 5 fails (slope 0.426). The true limit is in [4, 5), at this grid's resolution and the 420 W power limit.
- **Deviation from the plan's definition:** `summarize()` `throughput` counts requests that *arrived* in the measured window and eventually completed, including during the drain, whereas the plan defines throughput as completions per second. It therefore stays near λ during overload (λ = 6 reports 6.12), so in this sweep the queue-slope condition did the rejecting. It cannot change μ_warm: this column can only make a run look better, and every rate above 4 already fails on slope.
- **λ = 8 is not rerun:** λ = 10 is VALID, so the curve already has a valid overloaded point.

## 2026-10-30 · Step 4 follow-up: true completion rate and unsettled runs
- **μ_warm stays 4 with completions per second:** λ = 4 completes 3.991 req/s in the measured window (0.998 of λ). λ = 5 completes 4.723 (0.945), so it fails on this measure as well. The most the server completed at any rate is about 4.7 req/s, and that falls under heavier overload (λ = 8: 4.34, λ = 10: 4.19).
- **Surprising:** hit rate falls with load while the queue is still empty (λ = 2: 0.73, λ = 3: 0.63, λ = 4: 0.49), and λ = 3 keeps drifting inside the measured window (thirds: 0.674, 0.625, 0.585; TTFT p50 0.092, 0.114, 0.126 s). So a 900 s run may not fully settle at these rates. The λ = 4 run was also close to its limits: KV usage peaked at 99.8 %, with 2 preemptions. The cause is not established. The step 6 long run is the direct test of whether these rates are stable.
